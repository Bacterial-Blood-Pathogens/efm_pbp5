# efm_pbp5
Code for the analysis of PBP5 in the enterococci.

The idea of this project is to assess the frequency of multiple PBP5-encoding genes in enterococci and to explore their epidemiological and genomic contexts. The code located in this repository works (1) predicting PBP5 orthologs in all complete Enterococcus assemblies available in the NCBI database through modified reciprocal BLASTP and (2) comparing their genetic arrangements. Reciprocal BLASTP rationale was slighlty modified here to accept paralogs by taking more than one hit in the first BLASTP.
